      <description>The first step in finding vulnerabilities in some kind of IoT device is getting its firmware. 5-10 years ago, it was extremely easy: firmware of every device was available on the manufacturer’s website. And while it’s still true in some cases, now there’s no more a one-size-fits-all solution. Now we have several ways of getting firmware, ranging from very easy to very hard.
Download: Very Easy Maybe the manufacturer still offers firmware for download to everyone in need.</description>

      <description>Last week marked a very important milestone for me: I conducted my first offline reverse engineering workshop. It took a lot of effort and energy, but it finally happened! I want to express special thanks to my colleagues without whom this couldn&amp;rsquo;t have happened for the idea, support in organizing and developing the idea further!
My first attempt at this was 4 years and 3 jobs ago and I’m really proud that after all this years, I managed to implement it exactly how I wanted.</description>

      <description>1. The Role of NS (Non-Secure) Memory Bits Each memory page in a system comes with a Non-Secure (NS) bit. The &amp;ldquo;Normal World&amp;rdquo; can only access memory with the NS bit set, while the &amp;ldquo;Secure World&amp;rdquo; has unrestricted access to both NS and Secure memory. The NS bit is crucial for compartmentalizing secure and non-secure operations. Learn more about NS memory.
2. Exception Levels (ELs) ARM CPUs utilize four levels of privileges, known as Exception Levels (ELs).</description>
